                <p><b>The Milwaukee Bucks</b> are an American professional basketball team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Bucks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded in 1968 as an expansion team, and play at the Fiserv Forum. Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, but on April 16, 2014, a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors one month later on May 16.The team is managed by Jon Horst, the team's former Director of Basketball Operations, who took over for John Hammond in May 2017.</p>
                <p>The Bucks have won one league title (1971), two conference titles (1971 and 1974), and 13 division titles (1971–1974, 1976, 1980–1986, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sidney Moncrief, Oscar Robertson, Bob Dandridge, Bob Lanier, Glenn Robinson, Ray Allen, Sam Cassell, Junior Bridgeman, Michael Redd, Terry Cummings, Vin Baker, Jon McGlocklin, Marques Johnson, and Brian Winters.</p>
                <p>On January 22, 1968, the NBA awarded a franchise to Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc. (Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman; A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating. While the most-voted fan entry was the Robins, named for Wisconsins state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the Bucks, which was a reference to Wisconsins official wild animal, the white-tailed deer. One fan, R. D. Trebilcox, was awarded a new car for his part in reasoning why the Bucks was a good nickname, saying that bucks were spirited, good jumpers, fast and agile. The Bucks marked a return of the NBA to Milwaukee after 13 years; their previous team, the Hawks, played for four seasons in the early 1950s before moving to St. Louis in 1955 (they are now based in Atlanta).</p>
                <h1 id="header_content">Last Wins</h1>
                <p>The 2016–17 Milwaukee Bucks season was the 49th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).[1] For the first time since 2010, the Bucks had a winning record in the regular season.

                    The Bucks finished the regular season with a 42–40 record, securing the 6th seed. In the playoffs, they faced off against the 3rd seeded Toronto Raptors, where they lost in six games. It would also be the last season with John Hammond as general manager. He would leave his spot to become the general manager of the Orlando Magic on May 23, 2017.</p>
